<property>
    <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
    <value>true</value>
    <description>The mode the cluster will be in. Possible values are
    false: standalone and pseudo-distributed setups with managed Zookeeper
    true: fully-distributed with unmanaged Zookeeper Quorum (see hbase-env.sh)

    <value>3</value>
    <description>The replication count for HLog and HFile storage. Should not be greater than HDFS
    datanode count.

<property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>[[ZOOKEEPER_HOSTNAMES_COMMA_SEPERATED]]</value>
    <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
    For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
    By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
    of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
    list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh
    this is the list of servers which we will start/stop ZooKeeper on.
